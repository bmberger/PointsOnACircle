LEARNING MOMENTS: I learned a lot from this lesson, especially in terms of small little mistakes. For example, when negating y2, I realized that it also negated 0.0, so I had to create an if-else statement to ensure that it didnâ€™t do that. 
WHAT I ENJOYED: It was fun mixing my knowledge of math and square roots to code.
